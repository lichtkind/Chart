2.4.10 Upload to pause.perl.org failed for version 2.4.9. Therefore, the version 2.4.9 was renamed to 2.4.10
      for a new upload.

2.4.9 Upload to pause.perl.org failed for version 2.4.8. Therefore, the version 2.4.8 was renamed to 2.4.9
      for a new upload.
       
2.4.8 Bug repaired: rt.cpan.org #81171::Composite w/two ::Lines and xy_plot ==> undefined value when drawing ticks
      (t/composite_7.t and t/composite_8.t are showing the differences)
      Base.pm: defined(@array) 
      Chart.pod corrected for deprecated @ARR->[$i]

2.4.7 Not published
      
2.4.6 Number of named colors extended
      Documentation.pdf explains the use of colors (Appendix added) 
      Corrections in base.pm, routines
       _draw_bottom_legends, _draw_x_number_ticks
       in LinesPoints.pm, routines  _draw_data
 
2.4.5 Typo in _draw_x_ticks corrected
      Methods scalar_png(), scalar_jpeg() corrected for result.
      Test routine t/scalarImage.t added
      Chart.pod corrected

2.4.4 The brush styles to points and linespoints are extended.
      Not only circles represent the points but a number of different
      brush styles, linke donut, Star and so on.

2.4.3 Corrections to imagemap production in Composite.pm and Lines.pm

2.4.2 Changes done by R. Dassing, Michael Potter
      Base.pm:
      The values for 'true' resp. 'false' may be of the following
      true: TRUE, true, T, t, 1 and defined
      false: FALSE, false, F, f, 0 or undefined
      
      Base.pm:
      Added new options xlabel and xrange which is valid for xy_plot
      and Chart::Lines, Chart::Points, Chart::LinesPoints,
      Chart::Split, Chart::ErrorBars.
      
      In order to use the labels, the chart module needs to have 'xlabels' 
      AND 'xrange' set. Below is some example code for use: 
      @labels = (['Jan', 'Feb','Mar'], 
                 ['10','40','70']); 
      $chart->set( xlabels => \@labels, 
                   xrange => [0,100] ); 
      This options allow to set and position labels at the x-axis arbitrary.

      add_dataset() and app_pt() accepts now datasets as lists and as
          references to list like already mentioned in the docs


      Pie.pm: 
      Optimized organisation of the placement of the labels.
      Added flag to avoid plotting of legends at all
      Using GD Version 2.0.36 as this version supports 'filledArc'

      Composite.pm:
      Correction due to Request 23166
      write the endmost value of input array
      in imagemap_data array
      
      Lines.pm:
      Correction due to Request 23166: 
      write the endmost value of input array
      in imagemap_data array
      
      
      
2.4.1 Changes done by Christine Zilker, Gerhard Stuhlpfarrer, R. Dassing
        Added new Options:

        Positioning of the description optimized in Pie
        Division by zero problem fixed in Pie
        Module 'Bars' checks for numeric data a input on y-axis

            maximum  - determine maximal value of an array of numeric values
            arccos   - arccos
            arcsin   - arcsin
        Some small bugs corrected:
            Base::_find_y_scale
            Base::_find_y_range   : check for numeric values
            Base::_find_x_range   : check for numeric values
        Latex sources for documentation included 
            (We hope to get a better documentation be a native english speaking person)
                 
2.3  Changes done by Christine Zilker:
        Added new Options: 
         in Composite: 
                legend_example_height    changes thickness of the lines in the legend,
            f_y_tick1, f_y_tick2 analog to f_y_tick 
                                         used for right and left y-axes
         in Direction: 
                pairs                    

        Added the possibility to add more datasets in Chart::Direction 
               
    Fixed "label space" problem in Pie
    Fixed dataset order (in the legend) in StackedBars
    Fixed problem of getting the right values if round2Tick is used
    Fixed problem of datavalues in _find_y_scale
    Some minor bugfixes     

        Update of the Documentation (Documentation.pdf)

        The requested support of TruType fonts was currently dropped due to
        missing support in GD.pm (even in new versions)
        
        The print out of some hints and warnings where deleted not to confuse
        the user.

2.2: Composite.pm: imagemap_dump() repaired.

2.1: Changes done by Markus Brandl:
    new Modules added: ErrorBars.pm, HorizontalBars.pm, Pareto.pm,                          
     
    Pie.pm, Split.pm and Direction.pm

        Subdirectory "doc" contains a Acrobat Reader Documentation.pdf file.

    Function add_datafile() added. It is now possible to add a complete
    datafile.

        Added new Options: precision, xy_plot, min_x_ticks, max_x_ticks,
    skip_y_ticks, skip_int_ticks, legend_label_value, y_axes,
    scale, interval, start, interval_ticks, sort, same_error, point,
    line, arrow, angle_interval, min_circles, max_circles
    Also added: the 'title' and 'x_label' options in the colors option 

    Documentation (Documentation.pdf) added.

    _find_x_scale, _find_x_range and _draw_x_number_ticks added to make 
    xy_plots possible.

    _sort_data has now a body. 

        Fixed integer ticks problem by adding the skip_int_ticks option
    Fixed f_x_ticks and f_y_ticks problem in Composite
    Fixed negative value problem in Bars
    Fixed min_val and max_val problem in draw_data function of all modules:
    Now, Chart plots the data only if the data is in the area of min_val and
    max_val! The border of bars in Bars, HorizontalBars and StackedBars will
    be plotted pink (not misccolor) if the data isn't in the min_val-max_val
    interval.
    Fixed custom_x_ticks problem in _draw_x_ticks
    Some other bugfixes.
    Updates in _find_y_scale, _round2tick, _calcTickInterval 
       

1.1: Changes done by David Pottage:
        Plot scales can now have any magnitude. 
        It does not matter if the data covers a range of 100000000000 units
        or 0.00000000001 units, the scale will be correctly calculated.

        Ticks on plot scales are now plotted on 'round' numbers. 
        The number & spacing of ticks is chosen based on the data range.

        False zero graphs are now explicitly supported, and will be 
        generated if the data range merits it. 
        The instance field 'include_zero' should be set to zero to suppress this.

        Added: include_zero, min_y_ticks, max_y_ticks, integer_ticks_only
