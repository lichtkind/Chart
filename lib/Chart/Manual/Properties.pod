Chart::Manual::Properties - Complete Guide to Chart's changeable Properties

=head1 INTRO

Individual properties of a chart can be changed via method C<set>:

    $chart->set( %properties);
    $chart->set( key => 'value', ... );

This page documents all viable keys and values for this operation.


=head1 DATA TYPES

Every key expects values of a certain data type. The more often occurring
types are listed in this section.

=head2 boolean

Yes or no decisions you can answer with the perlish C<0> or C<1> as well
as with C<'true'> or C<'false'>, which might be shortened to C<'f'>, C<'F'>,
C<'t'> or C<'T'>. C<'none'> as an alias of C<'false'> is also an option.

=head2 color

To defined colors you have several options: names ('blue'),
RGB triplets ([0,255,255]) or HSL hashes 
({ hue => 240, saturation => 100, lightness => 50 }) are the usual ones.
Detailed explanation and even more options you find under
L<Chart::Color>.

=head2 font

There are a handful GD built in font object, than can be referenced:

    GD::Font->Tiny
    GD::Font->Small
    GD::Font->MediumBold 
    GD::Font->Large
    GD::Font->Giant


=head2 integer

Whole numbers

=head2 positive integer

Integers greater or equal zero.

=head2 real


=head2 string

text

=head1 SORTED ALPHABETICALLY

=head2 angle_interval

L</Direction> only: how many radial lines should be drawn. 
The default value is 30, which means that a line will be drawn every
30 degrees. Valid Values are: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 and 60. 
If you choose 0, direction will draw no line.

=head2 arrow

L</Direction> only: L<Bool|/boolean> that if C<'true'>, chart will draw a
arrow from the center to the point. Defaults to C<'false'>.

=head2 brush_size

L</Lines> only: Integer sets the width of the lines in pixels. Default is 6.

=head2 background

see L</color>

=head2 brushStyle

Sets the shape of points for Chart::Points, Chart::LinesPoints.

Possible values are: 'FilledCircle', 'circle', 'donut', 'OpenCircle', 
'fatPlus', 'triangle', 'upsidedownTriangle', 'square', 'hollowSquare', 
'OpenRectangle', 'FilledDiamond', 'OpenDiamond', 'Star', 'OpenStar'.
Default: 'FilledCircle

=head2 brush_style1

Composite only: brush style of points associated with left y-axis.

=head2 brush_style2

Composite only: brush style of points associated with right y-axis.
 
=head2 colors

The key C<color> is special, because there are a lot of things that
need to be colored.
its value has to be a hash
the name of 
This option lets you control the C</color>s the chart will use.  It takes
a reference to a hash.  The hash should contain keys mapped to references
to arrays of rgb values.  For instance,

    $obj->set('colors' => {'background' => [255,255,255]});

sets the background color to white (which is the default).  Valid keys for
this hash are

    'background' (background color for the image)
    'title' (color of the title)
    'text' (all the text in the chart)
    'x_label' (color of the x-axis label)
    'y_label' (color of the first y axis label)
    'y_label2' (color of the second y axis label)
    'grid_lines' (color of the grid lines)
    'x_grid_lines' (color of the x grid lines - for x axis ticks)
    'y_grid_lines' (color of the y grid lines - for to left y axis ticks)
    'y2_grid_lines' (color of the y2 grid lines - for right y axis ticks)
    'dataset0'..'dataset63' (the different datasets)
    'misc' (everything else, ie. ticks, box around the legend)

NB. For composite charts, there is a limit of 8 datasets per component.
The colors for 'dataset8' through 'dataset15' become the colors
for 'dataset0' through 'dataset7' for the second component chart.
More options how to define colors are described under L<Chart::Color>.

=head2 composite_info

This option is only used for composite charts.  It contains the
information about which types to use for the two component charts,
and which datasets belong to which component chart. It should be
a reference to an array of array references, containing information 
like the following

    $obj->set ('composite_info' => [ ['Bars', [1,2]],
                     ['Lines', [3,4] ] ]);

This example would set the two component charts to be a bar chart and
a line chart.  It would use the first two data sets for the bar 
chart (note that the numbering starts at 1, not zero like most of
the other numbered things in Chart), and the second two data sets
for the line chart.  The default is undef.

NB. Chart::Composite can only do two component charts.

=head2 custom_x_ticks

Used in points, lines, linespoints, errorbars and bars charts, this option
allows you to you to specify exactly which x-ticks and x-tick labels should
be drawn.  It should be assigned a reference to an array of desired
ticks.  Just remember that I'm counting from the 0th element of the
array.  (ie., if 'custom_x_ticks' is assigned [0,3,4], then the 0th,
3rd, and 4th x-ticks will be displayed)

=head2 datasetx

see L</color>

=head2 f_x_tick

Needs a reference to a function which uses the x-tick labels generated by
the '@data[0]' as the argument. The result of this function can reformat
the labels. For instance

   $obj -> set ('f_x_tick' => \&formatter );

An example for the function formatter: x labels are seconds since an event. 
The referenced function can transform this seconds to hour, minutes and seconds.

=head2 f_y_tick

The same situation as for 'f_x_tick' but now used for y labels.

=head2 f_y_tick1

Only for composite charts, needs a reference to a function 
which has one argument and has to return
a string which labels the first resp. second y axis.
Both default to undef.

=head2 f_y_tick2

Only for composite charts, needs a reference to a function 
which has one argument and has to return
a string which labels the first resp. second y axis.
Both default to undef.

=head2 graph_border

Sets the number of pixels used as a border between the title/labels
and the actual graph within the image.  Defaults to 10.

=head2 grey_background

Puts a nice soft grey background on the actual data plot when
set to 'true'.  Default is 'true'.

=head2 grid_lines

Draws grid lines matching up to x and y ticks. 

=head2 imagemap

Lets Chart know you're going to ask for information about the placement
of the data for use in creating an image map from the png.  This information
can be retrieved using the imagemap_dump() method.  NB. that the 
imagemap_dump() method cannot be called until after the Chart has been
generated (ie. using the png() or cgi_png() methods).

=head2 include_zero

If 'true', forces the y-axis to include zero if it is not in the dataset
range. Default is 'false'.

In general, it is better to use this, than to set the 'min_val' if that
is all you want to achieve.

=head2 integer_ticks_only

Specifies how to draw the x- and y-ticks: as floating point 
('false', '0') or as integer numbers ('true', 1). Default: 'false'

=head2 interval

Also a required value for a split chart. It sets the interval of one line
to plot. Defaults 'undef'.

=head2 interval_ticks

Sets the number of ticks for the x-axis of a Split chart. Defaults to 5.

=head2 label_font

This option changes the font of the labels. The key has to be a GD font. 

=head2 legend

Specifies the placement of the legend.  Valid values are 'left', 'right',
'top', 'bottom'.  Setting this to 'none' tells chart not to draw a
legend.  Default is 'right'.

=head2 legend_example_size

Sets the length of the example line in the legend in pixels. Defaults to 20.

=head2 legend_font

This option changes the font of the text in the legend. 
The key has to be a GD font. 

=head2 legend_labels

Sets the values for the labels for the different data sets.  Should
be assigned a reference to an array of labels.  For example,

  @labels = ('foo', 'bar');
  $obj->set ('legend_labels' => \@labels);

Default is empty, in which case 'Dataset 1', 'Dataset 2', etc. are
used as the labels.  

=head2 legend_label_values

Tells a pie chart what labels to draw in the legend. Valid values are
'percent', 'value', 'both' and 'none'. Defaults to 'value'.

=head2 label_values

Tells a pie chart what labels to draw beside the pie. Valid values are
'percent', 'value', 'both' and 'none'. Defaults to 'percent'.

=head2 line

If you turn this option to 'true', then direction will connect the points 
with lines. Defaults to 'false'.

=head2 max_circles

Sets the maximum number of circles when generating a scale for direction.
Default is 100. This limit is used to avoid plotting  an unreasonable 
large number of ticks if non-round values are used for the min_val and
max_val.

=head2 max_val

Sets the maximum y-value on the graph, overriding the normal auto-scaling.
Default is undef.


=head2 max_val1

Only for composite charts, these options specify the maximum y-value
for the first and second components respectively.  Both default to
undef.

=head2 max_val2

Only for composite charts, these options specify the maximum y-value
for the first and second components respectively.  Both default to
undef.


=head2 max_x_ticks

Work similar as 'max_y_ticks' and 'min_y_ticks'. Of course, only for a 
xy_plot.

=head2 max_y_ticks

Sets the maximum number of y_ticks to draw when generating a scale.
Default is 100. This limit is used to avoid plotting an unreasonable
large number of ticks if non-round values are used for the min_val
and max_val.

The value for 'max_y_ticks' should be at least 5 times larger than
'min_y_ticks'.

=head2 min_circles

Sets the minimum number of circles when generating a scale for direction.
Default is 4, minimum is 2.

=head2 min_val

Sets the minimum y-value on the graph, overriding the normal auto-scaling.
Default is undef.

Caution should be used when setting 'max_val' and 'min_val' to floating
point or non-round numbers. This is because the scale must start & end
on a tick, ticks must have round-number intervals, and include round
numbers.

Example: Suppose your data set has a range of 35-114 units. If you specify
them as the 'min_val' & 'max_val', the y_axis will be plotted with 80 ticks
every 1 unit.. If no 'min_val' & 'max_val', the system will auto scale the
range to 30-120 with 10 ticks every 10 units.

If the 'min_val' & 'max_val' are specified to excessive precision, they may
be overridden by the system, plotting a maximum 'max_y_ticks' ticks.

=head2 min_val1

Only for composite charts, these options specify the minimum y-value
for the first and second components respectively.  Both default to
undef.

=head2 min_val2

Only for composite charts, these options specify the minimum y-value
for the first and second components respectively.  Both default to
undef.

=head2 min_x_ticks

Work similar as 'max_y_ticks' and 'min_y_ticks'. Of course, only for a 
xy_plot.

=head2 min_y_ticks

Sets the minimum number of y_ticks to draw when generating a scale.
Default is 6, The minimum is 2.

=head2 no_cache

Adds Pragma: no-cache to the http header.  Be careful with this one, as
Netscape 4.5 is unfriendly with POST using this method.

=head2 pairs

Only used for direction how to handle more datasets. 
               If 'pairs' is set to 'true', 
               Chart uses the first dataset as a set of degrees and 
               the second dataset as a set of values. 
               Then, the third set is a set of degrees and the fourth a set of values \dots. \\
               If 'pairs' is set to 'false', 
               Chart uses the first dataset as a set of angels 
               and all following datasets as sets of values.
               Defaults to 'false'.

Sets the maximum number of circles when generating a scale for direction.
Default is 100. This limit is used to avoid plotting  an unreasonable 
large number of ticks if non-round values are used for the min_val and
max_val.

=head2 png_border

Sets the number of pixels used as a border between the graph
and the edges of the image.  Defaults to 10.

=head2 point

Indicates to draw points in a direction chart. 'true' or 'false' possible. 
Defaults to 'true'.

=head2 polar

Direction only: If set C<true>, the maximum x value is in the center
of the coordinate system. Defaults to 'false'.

=head2 precision

Sets the number of numerals after the decimal point. Affects in most
cases the y-axis. But also the x-axis if 'xy_plot' was set and also
the labels in a pie chart. Defaults to 3. 

=head2 pt_size

Sets the radius of the points (for Chart::Points, etc.) in pixels.  
Default is 18.

=head2 ring

Pie charts only: sets the "thickness" of the pie, the percentage of
the radius, which is visible. Defaults to 1 (normal pie chart).
Good values are between 0.2 and 0.4.

=head2 scale

Every y-value of a split chart will be multiplied with that value, but
the scale won't change. Which means that split allows one to overdraw certain 
rows! Only useful if you want to give prominence to the maximal amplitudes
of the data. Defaults to 1. 


=head2 same_error

This is a option only for ErrorBars. It tells chart that you want use the same 
error value of a data point if set to 'true'. Look at the documentation
to see how the module ErrorBars works. Default: 'false'.

=head2 same_y_axes

Forces both component charts in a composite chart to use the same maximum 
and minimum y-values if set to 'true'.  This helps to keep the composite 
charts from being too confusing.  Default is undef.

=head2 skip_int_ticks

If 'integer_ticks_only' was set to 'true' the labels and ticks will 
be drawn every nth tick. Of course in horizontalBars it affects the
x-axis. Default to 1, no skipping. 

=head2 skip_x_ticks

Sets the number of x-ticks and x-tick labels to skip.  (ie.  
if 'skip_x_ticks' was set to 4, Chart would draw every 4th x-tick
and x-tick label).  Default is undef.

=head2 sort

In a xy-plot, the data will be sorted ascending if set to 'true'.
(Should be set if the data isn't sorted, especially in Lines, Split 
and LinesPoints) In a Pareto Chart the data will be sorted descending. 
Defaults to 'false'.

=head2 skip_y_ticks

Does the same for the y-axis at a HorizontalBars chart as 'skip_x_ticks'
does for other charts. Defaults to 1.

=head2 spaced_bars

Leaves space between the groups of bars at each data point when set
to 'true'.  This just makes it easier to read a bar chart.  Default
is 'true'.

=head2 start

Split only: Sets the start value of the first interval.
If the x coordinate of the first data point is zero, you should 'set' to
zero. Default is 'undef'.

=head2 sub_title

Write a sub-title under the L</title> in smaller letters. 
Default is empty.

=head2 text_space

Sets the amount of space left on the sides of text, to make it more
readable.  Defaults to 2.


=head2 tick_label_font

This is the font for the tick labels. It also needs 
a GD font object as an argument.

=head2 tick_len

Sets the length of the x- and y-ticks in pixels.  Default is 4. 

=head2 title

Content of title text. If empty, no title is drawn.  
It recognizes '\n' as a newline, and acts accordingly.
Remember, if you want to use normal quotation marks instead of single 
quotation marks then you have to quote "\\n". Default is empty.


=head2 title_font

This option changes the font of the title. The key has to be a GD font. 
eg. GD::Font->Large


=head2 transparent

Makes the background of the image transparent if set to 'true'.  Useful
for making web page images.  Default is 'false'.

=head2 x_grid_lines

Draws grid lines matching up to x ticks if set to 'true'. Default is false.

=head2 x_label

Tells Chart what to use for the x-axis label.  If empty, no label
is drawn.  Default is empty.

=head2 x_ticks

Specifies how to draw the x-tick labels.  Valid values are 'normal',
'staggered' (staggers the labels vertically), and 'vertical' (the
labels are draw upwards).  Default is 'normal'.

=head2 xy_plot

Forces Chart to plot a x-y-graph, which means, that the x-axis is also
numeric if set to 'true'. Very useful for mathematical graphs.
Works for Lines, Points, LinesPoints and ErrorBars. Split makes always a 
xy_plot. Defaults to 'false'.

=head2 y_label

Tells Chart what to use for labels on the standard, left y-axis.
If empty, no label is drawn.  Default is empty.

=head2 y_label2

Tells Chart what to use for labels on the second, 
right y-axis (if different from left).
If empty, no label is drawn.  Default is empty.

=head2 y_ticks2

Only for composite charts, the number of y ticks to use on the first and
second y-axis on a composite chart.  Please note that if you just set the
'y_ticks' option, both axes will use that number of y ticks.
Both default to undef.

=head2 y_axes

Tells Chart where to place the y-axis. Has no effect on Composite and Pie.
Valid values are 'left', 'right' and 'both'. Defaults to 'left'.

=head2 y_grid_lines

Draws grid lines matching up to y ticks if set to 'true'. Default is false.

=head2 ylabel2

The label for the right y-axis (the second component chart) on a composite
chart.  Default is undef.

=head2 y_ticks1

Only for composite charts, the number of y ticks to use on the first and
second y-axis on a composite chart.  Please note that if you just set the
'y_ticks' option, both axes will use that number of y ticks.
Both default to undef.
